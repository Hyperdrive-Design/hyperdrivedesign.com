## High-speed CoreXY upgrade

The Hyperdrive Galaxy Pulse is a high-speed, all-metal CoreXY upgrade for the Ender 5, designed for better precision, speed, and reliability. For those wanting a complete build, we also offer a full-frame option with a reinforced structure and premium components.

## Hypernova printhead support

Galaxy Pulse uses our [Hypernova Printhead], with the same hotend and extruder support. Compatible hotends include the [Rapido UHF/HF], [TZV6 w/MZE], [Dragon Ace], and [Chube Air]. Supported extruders include [Annex Engineering Sherpa (CNC)], [orbiter 2.0/2.5], [G2SA], [WWBMG], and [Bondtech LGX Lite/Pro].

## Beacon probe

Galaxy Pulse uses the [Beacon] surface scanner, which uses eddy current sensing to scan the bed quickly with sub-micron precision right before the first layer.

## Cartographer probe

Galaxy Pulse also supports the [Cartographer V4] eddy current displacement sensor with USB/CAN support and a low-profile, all-in-one design.

## Options

- **Upgrade kit**
  All-metal CoreXY conversion for Ender 5 printers

- **Full-frame build**
  Reinforced structure with CNC aluminum motion components and printed ABS/ASA parts, including a Klicky Klack door that seals against foam and uses magnetic latching
