### Hybrid CNC-machined

The Hybrid HyperDrive Galaxy One is a 300mm³ CoreXY 3D printer with a hybrid CNC aluminum and ABS motion system. Designed for speed and precision, it comes in 24V or 48V configurations and offers an option for high-temp printed parts instead of ABS to withstand higher chamber temperatures. With a Beacon leveling system for fast, contactless bed leveling ensuring precise first layer calibration. The printer is also available with either the [Rapido UHF/HF], the [TZV6 w/MZE], the [Dragon Ace], the [Chube Air] hotend for optimized performance.

For any of the printed parts, you will be added to the Beta_Test_Dev role in our Discord server, where you can find the STL files. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

CNC-machined aluminium parts are available for purchase on the [Beaverton Milestone Hobby] webstore.
