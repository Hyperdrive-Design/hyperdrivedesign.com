## Belted-Z Cartesian conversion kit

This is a conversion kit that will allow you to turn your Ender-3 printer and similar printers alike into a belted printer with an infinite Z-axis, allowing for infinitely "high" parts.

The actual belt runs back-to-front in respect to the printer.

The kinematics are Cartesian, keeping the motion system simple and familiar for Ender-3 style printers.

The X axis uses a one-piece metal bar riding on linear rails for fast, precise motion.

The printhead uses CPAP cooling with an [E3D Revo Voron](https://e3d-online.com/products/revo-voron) hotend and a 30-degree nozzle for belt printing. Revo's RapidChange nozzle system enables fast swaps and helps reduce downtime between nozzle changes.
