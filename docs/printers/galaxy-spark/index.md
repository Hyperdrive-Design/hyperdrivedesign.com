## High-performance CoreXY

The Hyperdrive Galaxy Spark is a 180mmA3 CoreXY 3D printer featuring a hybrid metal and ABS motion system. Designed for speed and precision, it offers a rigid yet lightweight structure, making it perfect for high-performance small-scale printing.

## Hypernova printhead support

Galaxy Spark uses our [Hypernova Printhead], with the same hotend and extruder support. Compatible hotends include the [Rapido UHF/HF], [TZV6 w/MZE], [Dragon Ace], and [Chube Air]. Supported extruders include [Annex Engineering Sherpa (CNC)], [orbiter 2.0/2.5], [G2SA], [WWBMG], and [Bondtech LGX Lite/Pro].

## Z-tilt leveling

It uses Klipper's Z-tilt to level the print bed quickly and keep it aligned.

## Beacon probe

Galaxy Spark uses the [Beacon] surface scanner, which uses eddy current sensing to scan the bed quickly with sub-micron precision right before the first layer.

## Cartographer probe

Galaxy Spark also supports the [Cartographer V4] eddy current displacement sensor with USB/CAN support and a low-profile, all-in-one design.
